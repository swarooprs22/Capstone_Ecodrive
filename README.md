# Capstone_Ecodrive
Eco Drive is a mobile application developed to address the pressing issue of vehicular
emissions, one of the largest contributors to urban air pollution. By combining
automated carbon footprint tracking with gamification and community engagement,
Eco Drive encourages users to adopt eco-friendly travel habits. The application analyzes
commute data using smartphone sensors to estimate carbon emissions and awards points
for improvements in travel choices. In this project, we present the design,
implementation, and evaluation of the Eco Drive application, demonstrating its efficacy
in reducing carbon footprints and fostering sustainable travel practices. 

Special thanks to team mates Jayanth V, Nithin, Lohith M C who helped developing the project.
